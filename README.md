# TODO
- Add a README for each service
- Add a systemd service file for each service
- Add a Dockerfile for each service

# Roadmap
- Make it more general, like be able to get any input from the API, then detect the
type of input and do something with it according to rules defined (in a DSL?), for example run the
service XYZ (example obs-new-discoveries).
- Make more inputs possible, not just the REST interface, but also the CLI, the web interface, and clipboard.
